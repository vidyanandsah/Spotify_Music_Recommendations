### • Preprocessed a comprehensive dataset of user preferences, listening history, and music attributes

### • Applied classification algorithms (PLA, Pocket, and SVM) to segment users based on music preferences

### • Trained shallow and deep neural networks for high-accuracy classification and preference prediction

### • Utilized regression techniques and unsupervised learning methods (K-means) to predict user ratings, 
  song enjoyment probabilities, and enhance recommendation quality
